The Maximum Unbiased Validation (MUV) group is a benchmark dataset selected from PubChem BioAssay by applying a refined nearest neighbor analysis. The MUV dataset contains 17 challenging tasks for around 90,000 compounds and is specifically designed for validation of virtual screening techniques.

The data file contains a csv table, in which columns below are used:
     "mol_id" - PubChem CID of the compound
     "smiles" - SMILES representation of the molecular structure
     "MUV-XXX" - Measured results (Active/Inactive) for bioassays:
         For details of assays, please refer to the Table 1 in the reference.
